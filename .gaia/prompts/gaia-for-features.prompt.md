 Use your Gaia protocol to execute. Use your specialized agents for efficiency and cost-effectiveness. All your testing must be done via the Docker stack (**We should preserve dev data where possible**). You must ensure the backend endpoints are functional and real data persists to the DB and comes back and so on. You must test all these endpoints using CURL. For the frontend you must do functional and visual testing using your **Playwright MCP tools**. Iterate on any issuesuntil perfect.  Fix what needs fixing regardless of scope, complexity, time whether the failures are related to your code or not. if you clone files and dirs, for example: "* 2.*", delete those and clean up properly. Don't close your browser when you're done. I will continue to test myself.
