| .gaia/designs/*.md | A collection of important design documentation for the solution, together with overview for the design system, expected repository structure and Docker setup. |

## Instructions
- Always think deeply with your thinking tools.
- Always double check your thoughts to ensure we get an optimal response at the end. This is free and fast. You must abuse this tool.
    - You must use your Gaia double check thought tool for this. This is **mandatory** for all tasks. Consider this a reviewer for all tasks, not just for help for when you struggle.
- Always break down complex tasks into smaller ones. So the expected structure in this case would be Gaia Plan > Level-1 Tasks > Level-2 Tasks.
- Always sync with the Gaia plan via your tools when there is a Gaia plan.
- Always continue Gaia plans with outstanding tasks.
- Always keep documenation current with any changes we make. This is a spec-driven system and the docs always have to reflect the code.
    - Always update and align existing documentation when you make changes to the codebase. We don't want additional documentation introduced with changes unless asked for.
- Always align with your Gaia plan. It's imperative that you always mark your tasks in the plan as done when you finish them. Ensure you always align the work you do with the plan. The expectation at the end of a plan is that all tasks are done.
- When you provide an update on which task is completed, ensure you also include how many tasks are left or the total tasks next to the completed task. This is important for tracking progress.
