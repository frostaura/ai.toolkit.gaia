**Result:** A complete, production-ready application with enterprise-grade quality and comprehensive testing!

#### Step 3.3 ⚠️ At The End (VALIDATION | MANDATORY)

**At the end of the run** we should run the following prompt repeatedly until our solution is as refined as we want it to be:

```
[FINALIZE|VERIFY|POLISH]
1. Ensure that the entire system has code comments, 100% unit test coverage and 0 errors or warnings.

2. Reflect on the [design documentation](./.gaia/designs/*.md), and ensure
  2.1. all use cases have properly been implemented across the system, including ALL method bodies and
  2.2. the UI/UX is properly tested and reflect the frontend design we captured by reflecting on [our comprehensive planning prompt](./.gaia/prompts/gaia-plan.prompt.md), the plan and ensure the entire system is properly implemented.

3. 🎨 **CRITICAL VISUAL QUALITY ASSURANCE**: Ensure your frontend is genuinely beautiful:
   - **Iterative Screenshot Process**: Create Playwright visual tests with screenshots at multiple viewport sizes (mobile: 375px, tablet: 768px, desktop: 1024px+)
   - **Critical Analysis**: Analyze each screenshot like a UI/UX specialist, scoring 0-100% on visual quality criteria
   - **Professional Standards**: Achieve impeccable styling - no unstyled components, proper spacing, consistent typography, perfect alignment
   - **Comprehensive State Testing**: Test ALL interactive states (default, hover, focus, active, disabled, loading, error, empty) with screenshots
   - **Human-like E2E Testing**: Navigate the application like a human tester - complete real user workflows, test all interactions, verify all functionality
   - **Template Cleanup Validation**: Remove ALL default template code, placeholder text, debug logs, and development artifacts
   - **Design Specification Compliance**: Compare against and exceed standards in `./.gaia/designs/4-frontend.md`
   - **Visual Excellence**: REPEAT screenshot → analyze → fix process until 100% visual quality is achieved across all criteria
   - **Responsive Perfection**: Validate flawless responsive design across all breakpoints with smooth transitions

4. For all web server projects, there should be E2E tests for each endpoint too. For all frontends integrating with backends etc, there should be comprehensive and passing E2E tests too for every use case, unless impossible.

5. Ensure that ALL ROUTES on the frontends and ALL CONTROLLERS on the backend flow in perfect harmony. GAIA's Playwright tests shall validate this synchronization and all use cases as described in (./.gaia/designs/*.md).

6. For production readiness, all components must be implemented and fully tested with 100% test coverage.

7. **🔍 MANDATORY REGRESSION VALIDATION (NEW)**: Before considering the system complete:
   - **Feature Compatibility**: Verify ALL features work together without conflicts or breaking changes
   - **Complete Test Suite**: Run entire automated test suite and achieve 100% pass rate
   - **User Journey Validation**: Execute complete user workflows for every implemented feature to ensure end-to-end functionality
   - **Performance Consistency**: Validate that no feature degrades overall system performance beyond acceptable thresholds
   - **Integration Harmony**: Confirm that all frontend-backend integrations remain stable and functional

8. At the conclusion, ensure all tests achieve harmony - especially the visual regression tests.

9. Launch the application through the terminal. GAIA wishes to witness her creation in its final glory.
```

#### Step 3.4 Refinement

Communicate with GAIA using natural language to guide any changes or enhancements until your vision achieves perfect harmony.
